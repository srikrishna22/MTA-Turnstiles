# MTA-Turnstiles-

This project's aim was to devise a way to get the most number of signups for a Women's Technology Gala. 
We decided to target train stations that were near the largest Technology companies.
Turnstiles data was pulled from MTA(http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) and Tech companies data was scraped from
BuiltInNYC(https://www.builtinnyc.com/).

GeoPy/SciPy were used to calculate and minimize distances from station to company. 
And Folium was used to create an interactive map with suggestions of stations.
